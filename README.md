This repository contains exploratory data analysis and logistic regression of the heart diseases dataset from kaggle.

This repository contains the code, the dataset and the final report

Aim of the project: To perform exploratory data anlysis and create a model which tries to predict if a patient has heart disease or not based on the features.

Dataset description:

  age - age in years
  
  sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)

  cp - chest pain type
  
  trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)
  
  chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl
  
  fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)
  
  restecg - resting electrocardiographic results
  
  thalach - maximum heart rate achieved
  
  exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)
  
  oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest
  
  slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment
  
  ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy
  
  thal - 3 = normal; 6 = fixed defect; 7 = reversable defect
  
  target - have disease or not (1=yes, 0=no)
